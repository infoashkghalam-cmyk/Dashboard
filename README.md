# 🏛️ Achaemenid IoT Dashboard

A minimalist, modular, and high-performance IoT dashboard integrated with ESP32 control systems, featuring traditional Persian symbolic aesthetics, Cuneiform details, and modern Cloudflare/MQTT connectivity.

---

## 🎨 Aesthetics & Philosophy
This dashboard blends historical Persian legacy with modern technology:
- **Achaemenid & Traditional Motifs**: Features custom theme variables based on traditional colors (e.g., imperial purple, Pasargadae gold, stone grey) and dynamic Cuneiform backgrounds.
- **Micro-Animations**: Uses fluid motion interactions representing historical talismans and symbolic transitions.
- **Layout Adaptability**: Supports dynamic header positions (vertical sidebar / horizontal navbar) and responsive column layouts (1 to 3 columns grid system).

## ⚡ Tech Stack & Tools

- **Core**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (using `@theme` variables for dynamic styling)
- **Linter & Formatter**: Biome (for ultra-fast verification and code formatting)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Real-time Communication**: MQTT (via broker connectivity to ESP32 microcontrollers)
- **Data Querying**: TanStack React Query v5
